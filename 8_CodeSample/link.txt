Link to Spring's  Pet Clinic
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-petclinic.git


I believe that this code is excellent as it has the following qualities:

1. It has a site(http://static.springsource.org/docs/petclinic.html and https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-petclinic/wiki/home-petclinic) that documents what
 technologies that have been used, how to deploy the application and the architecture used.

2. Most of the codes contains well documented JavaDocs.

3. There are unit tests covering the model, service and web part

4. The codes itself is well layered, the packages are separated into the DAO,
business and service layers.
